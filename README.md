# Type.xml to Expansion Market converter

Quick made this tool with no experince at all but works so far, maybe there will be updates coming.
If something is not working let me know maybe i can update the tool for you.

**Version 1.0.0**

This tool will export items out of type.xml by dragging the XML on the EXE or double click the convertertoexpansion.exe while the type.xml is in same folder.
