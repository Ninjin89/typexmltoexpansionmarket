**Version 1.0.1**

This tool will export items out of type.xml by dragging the XML on the EXE or double click the convertertoexpansion.exe while the type.xml is in same folder.

**Please note that you have to change the DisplayName of the Trader because i left it empty!**

You may also need to change the InitStockPercent,Icon & Color to your liking.
