**Version 1.0.0**

This tool will export items out of type.xml by dragging the XML on the EXE or double click the convertertoexpansion.exe while the type.xml is in same folder.

!! Please not that you have to change the "DisplayName": "MyTraderName", !!

# Example of XML:

You may also need to change the InitStockPercent to your liking.
